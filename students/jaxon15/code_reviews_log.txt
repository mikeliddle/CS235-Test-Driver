The .sln file contains no code It shows the names of the files used in your project.  To find the .cpp file go to the folder containing your project (My Project).  Open the folder My Project.  Inside you'll find among other things My Project.sln and another folder named My Project. Open that folder and you'll find the .cpp files and .h files that you need to upload."
